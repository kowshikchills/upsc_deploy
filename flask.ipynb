       "'RBI Unveils 4-tiered Regulatory Framework for Urban Cooperative Banks A four-tiered regulatory framework for categorization of the Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) was recently released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It had also announced norms concerning the net worth and capital adequacy of these banks. Why is the four-tiered framework needed? The previous regulatory framework classified USCs into Tier I and Tier II. The new four-tiered framework was announced to ensure the effective regulation of the cooperative banking sector, which is heterogeneous in nature. This regulatory framework, based on the size of the deposits in the UCBs  seeks to balance the spirit of mutuality and cooperation found in smaller banks and those having limited areas of operations vis-à-vis the growth ambitions of the larger UCBs and those involved in more complex business activities. The categorization of the UCBs into four tiers ensures differentiated regulations that will strengthen the financial soundness of the UCBs. Four-Tiered Framework Categorization - Tier I includes all unit UCBs and salary earners’ UCBs (regardless of deposit size) and all other UCBs having deposits up to Rs. 100 crore. - Tier 2 covers UCBs having deposits more than Rs. 100 crore and up to Rs. 1,000 crore. - Tier 3 includes all banks having deposits higher than Rs. 1,000 crore and up to Rs. 10,000 crore. - Tier 4 has all UCBs having deposits higher than Rs. 10,000 crore. Minimum Net Worth - The minimum net worth of Tier I UCB operating in a single district must be Rs. 2 crore. For other UCBs in Tier 1, 2 and 3, the minimum net worth should be Rs. 5 crore. - Those UCBs that do not meet the revised minimum net worth are required to increase their net worth to Rs. 2 crore or Rs. 5 crore in a phased manner. Minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio - The capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR)  also known as the Capital Adequacy Ratio, is the ratio of a bank’s capital to its risk. - The RBI prescribed the minimum capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio that needs to be maintained by the UCBs. - The Tier I UCBs are required to maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 9 per cent of the Risk Weighted Assets on the on-going basis. Risk-weighted asset is a bank’s assets weighted according to the risk to determine the Capital Adequacy Ratio. - Other UCBs, from Tier 2 to 4, are required to maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets of 12 per cent of Risk Weighted Assets on the on-going basis.'"

       "'NEW DELHI: The government is seeking to bring climate finance, disaster risk reduction and startups to the forefront of the G20 agenda as India begins its presidency of the group of the world’s richest countries on Thursday, aiming to showcase its achievements and offer solutions around digital payments and e-services to position them as digital public goods. Disaster risk management and startups have made their way into the agenda for the first time, according to the details accessed by TOI. The government is keen to ensure global dialogue on building disaster and climate-resilient infrastructure. It also wants to ensure global dialogue on an early warning mechanism for certain types of disasters that affect lives in coastal areas. Given the need to push the climate agenda, the Modi administration will also seek that issues around financing, an areas where the developed countries have not kept their word, and a thrust to circular economy are addressed. Given the geo-political tensions at a time when the global economy is just recovering from the pandemic, India will also try to get countries that account for nearly 85% of global GDP to address issues around spillover effects of rate hikes in advanced economies on the emerging markets. Besides, the finance ministry is keen to get G20 members to work on creating a set of rules to deal with crypto currency. Sources said India will also seek to build consensus on issues around debt sustainability and reform of the multilateral systems to reflect the new realities. “India’s G20 presidency comes at an opportune time, not just for India but also the world.

       "'I\\'m writing some code (Python) to scrape text from web pages. My goal is to find a way to filter/delete the paragraphs on webpages that are not in the main article (e.g. advertisement, links to other articles, etc.). So far I\\'ve been using the .find_all(\"p\") command to extract only paragraphs from the text, which although successful also scrapes a lot of rudimentary paragraphs which are not in the main/body of each article. This is my code now: from urllib.request import Request, urlopen from bs4 import BeautifulSoup URLs = [ \"https://www.elsoldetoluca.com.mx/local/proponen-sistemas-para-captar-agua-pluvial-en-el-edomex-6585661.html\", \"https://www.elsoldetoluca.com.mx/local/agua-de-acuifero-del-valle-de-toluca-solo-debe-ser-para-uso-de-consumo-humano-especialista-4146232.html\" ] for url in URLs: req = Request(url, headers={\"User-Agent\": \\'Mozilla/5.0\\'}) page = urlopen(req) paragraphs = [] htmlParse = BeautifulSoup(page.read(), \\'lxml\\') for para in htmlParse.find_all(\"p\"): paragraph = para.get_text().replace(\"\\\\n\", \" \") paragraphs = paragraphs + [paragraph] text = str(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(paragraphs)) So I\\'m looking for a clever way to filter out the paragraphs that are not in the main article. It is essential that this method can be applied on any webpage, since I\\'m using this code on ~100 random websites. Things I\\'ve been looking into already is to filter paragraphs containing certain words, however, I would rather not do this because this way a lot of information/paragraphs are left out. Also, I\\'ve been looking at leaving out HTML sections with certain names (such as https://matix.io/extract-text-from-webpage-using-beautifulsoup-and-python/), but I find this is not very effective... Anyone any tips on how to do this elegantly? Thanks! <article>element or a <div class=\"article\">… then you can search for the paragraphs from this root element using the way you do.'"
